/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict owner-only access model for customer-related data,
 *              while allowing public read access to product information. It leverages path-based
 *              authorization for simplified and efficient security checks.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer profiles, accessible only by the customer.
 *  - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 *  - /customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoices, accessible only by the customer.
 *  - /invoices/{invoiceId}/invoiceItems/{invoiceItemId}: Stores invoice items, accessible only if the parent invoice is accessible.
 *  - /invoices/{invoiceId}/payments/{paymentId}: Stores payments, accessible only if the parent invoice is accessible.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - Customer data (profiles, invoices, payments) is strictly private and accessible only to the customer.
 *  - Product data is publicly readable.
 *  - Listing operations are secured based on path-based ownership.
 *  - The rules explicitly deny any unauthorized access.
