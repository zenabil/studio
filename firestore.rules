/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Mercurio POS.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customer-related data (invoices, payments, invoice items)
 * and allows public read access for products. Customers can only access data associated with their customer ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product information.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profiles.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Invoices belonging to a specific customer.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}/invoice_items/{invoiceItemId}: Items within an invoice.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}/payments/{paymentId}: Payments made for a specific invoice.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Products are publicly readable but not writable via client.
 * - Customers can only create their own profile, and updates are not allowed.
 * - Invoices, invoice items, and payments are strictly owned by the customer ID in the path.
 * - No listing of all users or invoices is allowed; listing is always scoped to the customer.
