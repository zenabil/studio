    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to efficiently manage products, customers, invoices, invoice items, and payments for the Mercurio POS application. The structure prioritizes Authorization Independence by avoiding hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules, ensuring atomic operations and simplified debugging. Path-based ownership is used for customer-owned data (invoices, payments). Structural Segregation ensures that documents within the same collection share identical security requirements.  Specifically:\n\n1.  **Products:** Products are stored in a flat `/products` collection. No ownership concerns are attached to products, they are global entities in this context.\n2.  **Customers:** Customers are stored in a flat `/customers` collection. The `id` field will correspond to the `customerId` in invoices.\n3.  **Invoices:** Invoices are stored within a subcollection of the specific customer document `/customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}`. This enforces path-based ownership, where only the customer (or authorized personnel) can access their invoices.\n4.  **Invoice Items:** Invoice items are stored within a subcollection of their parent invoice `/customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}/invoice_items/{invoiceItemId}`. This continues the ownership pattern, and allows for quick retrieval of all items associated with an invoice.\n5.  **Payments:** Payments are stored within a subcollection of the corresponding invoice `/customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}/payments/{paymentId}`. This maintains the customer-invoice-payment hierarchy for easy querying and data integrity.\n\nThis design ensures that the list operations (QAPs) are secure. For instance, listing invoices is done within the `/customers/{customerId}/invoices` collection, which inherently limits results to invoices associated with that customer, without needing filtering in rules.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved since we are not using `get()` in rules. The path `/customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}` implicitly authenticates that the user has the `customerId` to access the invoices"
